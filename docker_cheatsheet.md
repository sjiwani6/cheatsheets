# Docker Cheatsheet

## Overview

Docker allows you to run applications in a container rather than trying to run it on your own machine. When running, a Docker image can be used to create a single environment for the software to run on. More information [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/).

## Keywords
**Container** - a running image
